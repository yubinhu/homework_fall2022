## Setup

You can run this code on your own machine or on Google Colab. 

1. **Local option:** If you choose to run locally, you will need to install MuJoCo and some Python packages; see [installation.md](../hw1/installation.md) from homework 1 for instructions. There are two new package requirements (`opencv-python` and `gym[atari]`) beyond what was used in the previous assignments; make sure to install these with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `pip install gym[atari]`, and `pip install gym[accept-rom-license]` 
if you are running the assignment locally.

2. **Colab:** The first few sections of the notebook will install all required dependencies. You can try out the Colab option by clicking the badges below:
